# Orion's Belt - Phase 1 & 2 Audit Discrepancy Report

**Audit Task:** [#12 - Audit & Reconcile Phase 1 & 2 Deliverables](https://github.com/IncudoLABS/orions-belt/issues/12)
**Date:** 2025-07-14

## 1. Summary

This document outlines the findings from the comprehensive audit of the work completed in Phases 1 and 2. The audit's goal was to ensure alignment with the PRD, code quality standards, and architectural principles before proceeding with future development.

**Overall Conclusion:** The project is in excellent health. The core scripts are well-designed and robust, and the documentation is now consistent. The few discrepancies found were minor or have been resolved.

## 2. Audit Findings by Subtask

### Subtask 12.1: Verify Directory & File Structure
*   **Status:** PASSED
*   **Findings:** The project's directory and file structure are logical, well-organized, and align with the intended architecture. No discrepancies found.

### Subtask 12.2: Audit Script Metadata
*   **Status:** PASSED
*   **Findings:** A full audit confirmed that all `.yml` and `.yaml` playbook files within the `playbooks/` directory contain the required SPDX license identifier and copyright header. No missing headers were found.

### Subtask 12.3: Audit `run_playbooks.sh`
*   **Status:** PASSED (with minor observation)
*   **Findings:** The `run_playbooks.sh` script is exceptionally well-written, robust, user-friendly, and extensible. It demonstrates excellent error handling and a clear, modular design.
*   **Minor Observation:** A `show_help` function is defined within the script but is not called from the main loop. This is a non-critical observation and does not impact functionality.

### Subtask 12.4: Reconcile Core Documentation
*   **Status:** PASSED (Discrepancy resolved)
*   **Findings:** A significant discrepancy was identified in the `README.md` file. The "Getting Started" section contained outdated instructions that did not reflect the new environment-based configuration system used by the `run_playbooks.sh` script.
*   **Resolution:** The `README.md` has been updated. The outdated section was replaced with accurate, concise instructions that now link to the comprehensive `example_usage.md` for detailed guidance. All core documentation is now consistent.

## 3. Recommendations

No blocking issues were found. The project is cleared to proceed to the next phase of development.
