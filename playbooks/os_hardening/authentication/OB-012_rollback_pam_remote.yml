          This playbook will restore PAM configuration to fix broken SSH.
          Only use this if SSH authentication is broken!

          === NEXT STEPS ===
          1. Try SSH login again
          2. If still broken, you need console access
          3. Consider rebooting the server
          
          === IMPORTANT ===
          Security hardening has been reverted!
          Re-apply with caution after fixing root cause.
