      === MINIMAL FIREWALL CONFIGURATION ===
      Minimal services to allow: {{ minimal_allowed_services | join(', ') }}
      Minimal ports to allow: {{ minimal_allowed_ports | join(', ') }}
      
      This configuration provides maximum security by only allowing:
      - SSH (port 22) - Always allowed from local subnet
      - DNS (port 53) - For name resolution
      - NTP (port 123) - For time synchronization
      
      WARNING: This will block all other services including web servers,
      databases, and other applications. Only use this if you're sure
      no other services are needed.

      === MINIMAL FIREWALL CONFIRMATION ===
      
      WARNING: This configuration will block ALL services except:
      - SSH (port 22) - From local subnet only
      - DNS (port 53) - For name resolution
      - NTP (port 123) - For time synchronization
      
      This will likely break web servers, databases, and other applications.
